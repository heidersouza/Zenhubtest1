    <para>
      &quot;Important&quot; boxes detail things that are easily missed: configuration changes that only apply to the current session, or services that need restarting before an update will apply.
      Ignoring a box labeled &quot;Important&quot; will not cause data loss, but may cause irritation and frustration.
