<!-- STANDARD INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTROLLING ILT AND RAVELLO -->
<!-- INSTRUCTIONS:
- During development, the current version of this file should be copied from the git@github.com:RedHatTraining/skeleton.git repo.
- Normally, content developers should not need to directly edit this file, since it's common to all courses.
Changes should be submitted as a pull request to the copy in skeleton.
- Some unusual courses may need to have content here that diverges from the standard instructions.
These should be discussed with the architect and content services to ensure that this is needed for that course. -->

    In an instructor-led training classroom, students are assigned a physical computer (<code>foundation<replaceable>X</replaceable>.ilt.example.com</code>), which is used to access their virtual machines running on that host.
