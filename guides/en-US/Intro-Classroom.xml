  <para>
    In this course, the main computer system used for hands-on learning activities is <code>workstation</code>.
    <!-- UPDATE THIS LIST TO REFLECT YOUR CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT -->
    Eight other machines are also used by students for these activities:
    <code>servera</code>, <code>serverb</code>, <code>serverc</code>, <code>serverd</code>, <code>servere</code>, <code>serverf</code>, <code>tower</code>, and <code>utility</code>.
    All nine of these systems are in the <code>lab.example.com</code> DNS domain.
  </para>

  <para>
    All student computer systems have a standard user account, <code>student</code>, which has the password <code>student</code>.
    The <code>root</code> password on all student systems is <code>redhat</code>.

  <para>
    One additional function of <code>workstation</code> is that it acts as a router between the network that connects the student machines and the classroom network.
    If <code>workstation</code> is down, other student machines will only be able to access systems on the student network.
  </para>
  <para>
    Several systems in the classroom provide supporting services.
    Two servers, <code>content.example.com</code> and <code>materials.example.com</code>, are sources for software and lab materials used in hands-on activities.
    Information on how to use these servers is provided in the instructions for those activities.

  <!-- "Controlling Your Systems" include.

  The following include inserts the instructions on how to operate the classroom ("Controlling Your Systems") as a subsection of the Orientation to the Classroom section.
  It will appear to start with a bridgehead.
  The Common/Control-Classroom.xml file should be freshly copied from the skeleton to get the most up-to-date copy in the course.
  Normally, it should not be edited by course developers.
  If there is a need to customize the standard operating instructions, discuss with your architect and content services. -->
